The fact that Jesus is alive means that death is no longer the end of life, but it is the beginning of a new and eternal life in heaven. This truth gives people the courage to face their fears, the hope to overcome their struggles, and the confidence to live their lives with purpose and meaning.

In addition to providing hope, the resurrection of Jesus also offers forgiveness and new life. The gospel accounts tell us that Jesus died on the cross to take away the sins of the world. Through His death, He made a way for people to be forgiven and to have a relationship with God. The resurrection of Jesus also demonstrates the power of God to bring life out of death, and it is a symbol of Godâ€™s love for all people.
